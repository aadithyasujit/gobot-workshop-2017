## Intel TinyTILE

## Sensor Kit

### Sound Sensor

module that can be used with analog signal to measure sound threshold and/or with digital to detect if sound was made

### Light Sensor

analog luminescence detection module

### Magnetic Sensor - Digital

digital module with an led to detect the presence of a magnetic field

### Magnetic Sensor - Analog

analog module that is sensative to how near or far a magnet is detected 

### Red/Green LED - Small

"-" symbol is the ground, middle pin is the posative for green and the end labeled "s" is the posative for the green

### Red/Green LED - Large

"-" symbol is the ground, middle pin is the posative for green and the end labeled "s" is the posative for the green

### Temperature Sensor

5v module ground is on the "-" symbol 5v is the center pin,and signal is analog on the "s" labeled pin... Need to do proper math to get correct temperature

### Magnetic Sensor - Module

analog/digital magnetic feild module 5v red signal led included. A0 is anlog pin, "G" is ground ", "+" is 5v posative, D0 pin is the digital pin for this module

### Temperature Sensor - Module

analog/digital temperature sensor A0 is anlog pin, "G" is ground ", "+" is 5v posative, D0 pin is the digital pin for this module math needs work to get correct temp

### Touch Sensor - Module

analog/digital touch sensor A0 is anlog pin, "G" is ground ", "+" is 5v posative, D0 pin is the digital 

### Magnetic Reed Module

analog/digital magnetic reed sensor that open or close when exposed to a magnetic feild A0 is anlog pin, "G" is ground ", "+" is 5v posative, D0 pin is the digital red LED signals when magnet is near
 
### RGB LED (flat)

"-" symbol is ground, "R" symbol is green posative, "G" symbol is red posative, and "B" symbol is blue posative

### Light Cup

didgital gravity powered mercury switch, LED on switch does not appear to work tried 4 different sensors to test "G" is ground ", "+" is 5v posative S is digital signal(works), " L" is 5v led which appears to not work
